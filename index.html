				<h1>Let's build a better workspace</h1>
				<h3>"Without community there is no humanity!"</h3>
				<p>Co-manity's mission is simple: to build a stronger community inside and outside
				our office walls. We consist of a small group of individuals who have the flexibilty
				to work from home or remote but all found ourselves wanting more out of our everyday 
				work routine. Ideally Co-manity will be a co-working space where people can go to get out of the house, be more productive and also have the support of all our community members. Our inagural office is only accepting a limited number of participants so if you're looking for something more please contact us and help grow a great community!

							<h3>Free</h3>
							<p>We will select 10 members who will have the opportunity to have a dedicated desk and 24/7 access to the facility. All we ask is that you set aside an hour or two each week to explore ideas on how to improve our co-working community and also the communities surrounding us.

							<!-- Our inaugural office will be composed of approximately 30 members who will
							have their own dedicated workspace and access to the office 24/7. Our inagural office will not make a dime off any membership fees so you will pay what we pay. --></p>
