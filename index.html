				<h1>Let's build a better workspace</h1>
				<h3>"Without community there is no humanity!"</h3>
				<p>Co-manity's mission is simple: to build a stronger community inside and outside
				our office walls. We consist of a small group of individuals who have the flexibility
				to work from home or remote but all found ourselves wanting more out of our everyday 
				work routine. Ideally Co-manity will be a coworking space where people can go to get out of the house, be more productive, collaborate, socialize and also have the support of all our community members. Our inaugural Gilbert office is only accepting a limited number of participants so if you're looking for something more please contact us and help grow a great community of coworkers!

					<h2>Other coworking spaces</h2>

					<p>Most coworking spaces typically consist of large open workspaces or a type of shared office where someone can either buy into a membership or pay a fee in order to have a space to work. Usually you have three options: open seating (just find a free space and start working), dedicated desk or private office. Obviously, pricing will vary depending on the plan you choose and all coworking spaces differ as far as membership options, pricing and space available. However, what is pretty universal is the terminology. Terms such as collaborative workspace, community, flexibility, network, etc. are spewed out excessively with some delivering on those promises more than others but ultimately most are pretty much exactly what you would expect, simply just a place to plop down and get some work done.</p>

				<div class="why-different">
					<h2>Why we're different</h2>

					<p>Co-manity only has one goal - to help. Yes it’s boring, broad and simple but it’s what we do. We’re not looking to spin a profit or line our pockets and there’s no hidden agenda. Every dime we make outside our operating expenses will go directly back into the community or invested inside the walls of our office. This is more than just a place to plop down and work. This is your chance to make a difference. But don’t worry, if all you want is to plop down and be left alone you won’t be shunned or shamed. Life is hectic and sometimes there’s just not enough time in the day to go out and save the world. Every person who is a member is contributing by just being a part of it. Our hope is that the more involvement you see in the community the more you’ll want to be a part of it. Kindness is contagious and sometimes we forget how good it feels to help or even to receive help from others and for many people once you experience it, you just can’t ever get enough. We truly believe the more opportunity we provide for someone to make a difference the more likely they will.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="not-about-money">
					<h2>It's not about the money</h2>

					<p>I know we've all heard it before but it's really not. Instead it’s about surrounding yourself with good people because one thing you can never have enough of is good people in your life and when you’re consistently surrounded by good people, in our experience, good things tend to happen. It’s as simple as that. We promise our inaugural office will not make a single cent. We are simply looking to provide a productive workspace for anyone who needs a daily office or just a change of pace. We will make every effort to keep our costs down so not only do you have a great place to work but also get it at a great price. And remember every dollar we make over our operational costs will go directly back into the community. We've partnered with several local non-profits and small businesses here in Gilbert and the East Valley and rest assured you're money will go to a good cause because as a member of our coworking community not only do you have the opportunity to contribute and collaborate with fellow coworkers but you also have the opportunity to influence all the good that gets sent back into our local communities.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="coworking">
					<h2>Coworking Spaces vs Traditional Office Space</h2>

					<p>A lot of people ask what the difference is between coworking spaces and traditional office rental agencies. On paper there's not a whole lot anymore. Nowadays, most traditional agencies are trying to tap into the coworking market and advertise they offer coworking space. However, just because you have a few desks in a room where multiple people can work doesn't necessarily qualify as coworking. For us it really boils down to one thing, what are you selling. Are you selling people on office space or are you selling them on a community. You can have a hundred people in one room but if no one is collaborating or offering themself as a resource to anyone else in the office then, in our opinion, it just becomes a large room of wasted resources. Coworking isn't for everyone. Some people would rather stay to themselves and that's perfectly fine. In our experience though most people thrive when they are a part of a strong community and a community's strength is only as strong as the people in it. Sometimes we forget the accomplishments that can be made when we stick together!</p>
