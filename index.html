				<h1>Let's build a better workspace</h1>
				<h3>"Without community there is no humanity!"</h3>
				<p>Co-manity's mission is simple: to build a stronger community inside and outside
				our office walls. We consist of a small group of individuals who have the flexibility
				to work from home or remote but all found ourselves wanting more out of our everyday 
				work routine. Ideally Co-manity will be a co-working space where people can go to get out of the house, be more productive and also have the support of all our community members. Our inaugural office is only accepting a limited number of participants so if you're looking for something more please contact us and help grow a great community! 
				</p>

					<h2>What is a Co-working space</h2>

					<p>Most co-working spaces typically consist of large open workspaces or a type of shared office where someone can either buy into a membership or pay a fee in order to have a space to work. Usually you have three options: open seating (just find a free space and start working), dedicated desk or private office. Obviously, pricing will vary depending on the plan you choose and all co-working spaces differ as far as membership options, pricing and space available. However, what is pretty universal is the terminology. Terms such as collaborative workspace, community, flexibility, network, etc. are spewed out excessively with some delivering on those promises more than others but ultimately most are pretty much exactly what you would expect, simply just a place to plop down and get some work done.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="why-different">
					<h2>Why we're different</h2>

					<p>Co-manity only has one goal - to help. Yes it’s boring, broad and simple but it’s what we do. We’re not looking to spin a profit or line our pockets and there’s no hidden agenda. Every dime we make outside our operating expenses will go directly back into the community or invested inside the walls of our office. This is more than just a place to plop down and work. This is your chance to make a difference. But don’t worry, if all you want is to plop down and be left alone you won’t be shunned or shamed. Life is hectic and sometimes there’s just not enough time in the day to go out and save the world. Our hope is that the more involvement you see in the community the more you’ll want to be a part of it. Kindness is contagious and sometimes we forget how good it feels to help or even to receive help from others and for many people once you experience it, you just can’t ever get enough. We truly believe the more opportunity we provide for someone to make a difference the more likely they will.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="not-about-money">
					<h2>It's not about the money</h2>

					<p>I know we've all heard it before but it's really not. Instead it’s about surrounding yourself with good people because if there’s one thing you can never have too much of, it’s good people in your life and when you’re consistently surrounded by good people, in our experience, good things tend to happen. It’s as simple as that. We promise our inaugural office will not make a single cent. We are simply looking to provide a productive workspace for anyone who needs daily office or just a change of pace. We will make every effort to keep our first 10 members free of charge and everyone after that will never pay more than our listed prices but anything we make over our operating expenses will be refunded at a rate that reflects your price plan. So the more members we have the less you pay.</p>

							<!-- Our inaugural office will be composed of approximately 30 members who will
							have their own dedicated workspace and access to the office 24/7. Our inagural office will not make a dime off any membership fees so you will pay what we pay. --></p>
